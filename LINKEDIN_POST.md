# LinkedIn Post - LogNog Launch Teaser

---

## Post Version 1 (Narrative)

I've been a Splunk believer for over a decade. Built SOCs with it. Defended networks with it. Taught teams how to use it. Splunk was the gold standard.

But somewhere along the way, Splunk lost its way.

The dev license restrictions. The pricing that only Fortune 500s can stomach. The neglect of the homelab community that helped build their reputation. The acquisition by Cisco and all that comes with it.

So I built something.

**LogNog** - Your Logs, Your Control.

A self-hosted, open-source Splunk alternative that:
- Deploys in under 10 minutes (single docker-compose.yml)
- Uses ClickHouse for 10-100x better compression
- Speaks Splunk's query language (sort of)
- Runs 100% local - no cloud, no telemetry, no BS
- Actually cares about homelabs and small teams

Coming soon: **LogNog In** - an agent that watches your files, monitors integrity, and ships logs without the enterprise licensing nightmare.

The homelab community deserves better than being an afterthought.

Open source. Built with love. No strings attached.

## Post Version 2 (Technical)

After years of dealing with log management solutions that either:
- Cost more than my car
- Require a PhD to deploy
- Send my data to someone else's cloud
- Treat homelabs like second-class citizens

I decided to build something different.

**Introducing LogNog** - open-source log management that doesn't suck.

**The Stack:**
- ClickHouse (columnar storage, insane compression)
- Vector (log ingestion)
- React + TypeScript (modern UI)
- Custom DSL compiler (Splunk-like queries)
- JWT auth + API keys (enterprise-ready)

**The Vibe:**
- One `docker-compose up` to rule them all
- 1K-10K logs/sec (homelab scale)
- Sub-second search
- Dark mode (obviously)

**Coming Soon:**
- LogNog In agent (file watching, FIM, system tray)
- OpenTelemetry support
- Markdown/doc intelligence

Built by someone who actually runs a homelab.

## Post Version 3 (Short & Punchy)

Splunk forgot about us.

The homelabbers. The indie security researchers. The small teams doing big things on small budgets.

So I built LogNog.

Open source log management that:
- Deploys in minutes
- Runs 100% local
- Speaks Splunk (kind of)
- Actually respects your data

Your logs. Your control. No strings attached.
